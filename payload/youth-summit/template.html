      >“Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the
      time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” – Marie Curie</i
    >
  </p>
</strong>

<p>
  Now that we're moving from the scary, unknown part of the pandemic and
  understanding more about how to manage COVID through testing, vaccines, and
  masks controlling transmission, this event will focus on how technology is
  helping with COVID efforts and health in general.
</p>

<p>
  Listen to our live keynote from Luis Valentin-Alvarado, a Ph.D. candidate in
  the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology at UC Berkeley from Puerto Rico,
  about his journey from a non-scientific background to becoming a scientist
  working on innovative ways to develop a quick, inexpensive, at-home COVID test
  using CRISPR gene-editing technology that would be accessible to all!
</p>

<p>
  IMPORTANT: Our keynote, Luis Valentin-Alvarado, has offered a special breakout
  in Spanish after the keynote to students and their families! Please reply to
  this email or indicate on the Eventbrite registration
  <a href="http://2020-ttsf-global-youth-summit.eventbrite.com">(LINK)</a> if
  you would like to participate in the special breakout with Luis and share this
  opportunity with your network!
</p>

<p>
  Global Youth Summit participants will also have the opportunity to learn how
  youth can make a difference with the 2020 TeenTechSF Civic Hackathon winners
  and finalists presenting tech solutions to problems including social justice,
  sustainability, and distance-learning and get advice from the TeenTechSF
  Alumni panel on matriculating to top universities and STEM internship
  opportunities. Teens from around the world will come together online to learn
  about the intersection of technology and health, and its impact during
  COVID-19. This is a gateway tech experience for many and we are proud to
  welcome students who are new to tech and coding! As part of the event, you'll
  also be able to participate in interactive, beginner-friendly STEM workshops
  including COVID-19 Data Analysis, Introduction to Game Design with Pygame,
  Machine Learning, and Programming a Google Chrome Extension.
</p>

<p>
  Like all TeenTechSF events, this event is completely FREE, but advance
  registration is required! Open to all students 13-18 years old -- no previous
  coding experience necessary.
