Run by and for teens, TeenTechSF’s mission is to empower the next generation of tech innovators and civic entrepreneurs through equal access to tech for all teens. Since launching, TeenTechSF has connected nearly 2,000 students with STEM resources and opportunities through speakers, hands-on workshops, and civic hackathons. The California Academy of Sciences, UC Berkeley, Stanford RISE, and public schools, libraries, and community centers have all hosted TeenTechSF STEM workshops.  

Bentley Design Thinking Engineering Club is a hub for all things business, entrepreneurship, and innovation-related at the Bentley Upper School in Lafayette, California. Using the five-step Design Thinking Process as a guide, club meetings consist of workshops and conversations on problems we are facing in our own community - and solutions we can implement to fix them.
